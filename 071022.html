        Mom was talking about poetry this afternoon, about a girl who got famous by reciting poetries. Then I showed some lines I wrote. The poetry was, 
<br> <br>
‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶õ‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ø <br>
‡¶Æ‡¶∞‡ßÅ ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∏ <br>
‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶ø‡ßü‡ßá ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶ï <br>
‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶â‡¶∑‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶Ü‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∏ <br>
<br>
Then she was talking about a couple we know, (cannot share the story, sorry, it's too romanticüòÖ). So I don't know how, but I told her that someone wrote 3/4 dozens of poems on me. She said, okay, perfect. You treat mads, so you got a mad. Where's she from? I said she's from Saidpur. She was surprised, because my childhood tutor who eventually became very close to our family is from there. She was smiling all the time, and said, "‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶ñ‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶ï.." While going to washroom. And I left home for cycling.
