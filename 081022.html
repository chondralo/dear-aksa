       I don't know whether sharing my condition with you will be good or not. But the truth is, I cannot focus. 
       I haven't studied anything yet. Yesterday, my mom's expression was all that helped me feel better. 
       <br><br>
       Mom said you crazy, in a cute way. I wish she called me that way!
       <br><br>
       Last night I wanted to distract me. I wasn't aroused. But I kinda forcefully tried porn. But they didn't really work. 
       I deleted your resction video that day already. Because I cannot think about you in a certain way if you do not think about me the same way. 
       I still don't know what should I do. I actually cannot move until you open your heart naked in front of me. 
       You said you are tired of living in your head. Then why are you still living in your head? And now I think, I'm doing the same.
       Maybe less, but I cannot feel better if I don't know how are you feeling. Whatever is happening is not fair. 
       Aksa, all I want is you to be very frank. To cover darkness, going back to the shadow isn't the solution. Please open up. 
       All the things in your head. Good, bad, or evil. If it's evil, please don't keep that to you. Open up. I never judged you. 
       Never even questioned why Aksa is like Aksa. Please? Say them all? Is it fair, 
       that we've been sharing every single thing from the beginning, now stop sharing them at all? We held each other to heal each other.
       You know, when you try to hide something, I ruin things by saying something hard. I regret most at that time. Why did I say when this is not what i meant to say. 
       Just don't hide babe. I embrace your every part of you. Your heart, hormones, imperfections. 
       You want me to stay imperfect, so that you can keep loving me. Can't I wish the same for you?
