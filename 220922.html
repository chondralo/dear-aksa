    <p> Hope you’re doing well, hey, aren’t you? 
Last night I was reading when you asked. Ahm, didn’t want to make you excited and gear up the chat. I read few pages, maybe 15? Wasn’t that bad, right?
Hope you enjoy your day at college, and at home as well. <br>
Oh, and yesterday, when I opened tv while having dinner, there “beauty and the beast” was being played. No, I didn’t watch it, though it felt like watch till the end. But turned tv off after finishing my breakfast. Emma Watson is a french born woman, wow. Didn’t know until I googled about her yesterday. She’s a nice person. No?<br>
Okay, you take care of yourself. Working out?? Hope you are. 
<br> <br>
bonne <br>
journée
au revoir</p>
